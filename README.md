# Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rehmatullahi Wa Barakatahu

The Naskh Nastaleeq IndoPak text showcased on Quran.com and QuranWBW.com is a refined version of the standard IndoPak script available online. This improved text is designed to closely mirror the authentic IndoPak mushaf, complete with accurate pause marks and rounded ayah icons, enhancing its visual and resemblance to the traditional manuscript.

We have done our best efforts to make available this Indopak Quran Text in the best of its form and Quality.

## Madinah Version

For Madinah Version Text, we have Manually & Digitally Verified the Word-to-Word and Pausemark-to-Pausemark of this Quran Text with King Fahad Glorious Quran Printing Complex's Nastaleeq Text/Mushaf (v.10.0).

The Source of the Quran Text (digital file):
https://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp02/hafs-nastaleek

## Hanafi Version

For Hanafi Version Text, we have used Indopak Text which was originally made by Inpage Quran Publishing Software and was made available on the internet by Ata Rafi of typemybook.com. (see source link below)

The original Hanafi text was made available in HTML format with AlQalam font. We then manually split the text into word by word and compared this text with King Fahad Glorious Quran Printing Complex's Nastaleeq Text/Mushaf and digitally identified the differences. We then manually checked the differences that were digitally identified between both the versions and made adjustments by manually verifying each and every word and Ayah icon with the 13 lines Indopak Hanafi Quran (Mushaf) {which is famously used in Indian Subcontinent Region}. (See below link).

The Text & Font is based on Simple Ligatures, which makes the text easy to read by beginners and it is only the writing difference between the Mushaf and this digital Text. No other difference can be seen.

If you find any error, then please immediately send us the details with a screenshot (Text Version "Madinah or Hanafi", Surah Name and Ayah Number is a must) on "quranwbw@gmail.com or ayman24x7@gmail.com" and we will correct it In'Sha'Allah.

In'Sha'Allah there is no scope for any errors, but humans are made to errors and are not perfect.

_Important Note:_ This Indopak Quran Text is not fully Unicode Compatible (which means, no other font will work with these Text files) and will work only with the Included Font files.

## Special Font Requirement

We have made a custom font based on the old Al Qalam font that was included with the original text file. We created the font to solve some text issues and also to add some additional features.
